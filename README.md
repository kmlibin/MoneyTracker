### Project Highlights

This project was designed so that students could continue practicing all things React, but was also designed to introduce students to working with Firebase. 

    1. CSS Modules
    2. Using Reducers
    3. Setting up Links, Routes, and Protected Routes
    4. Conditionally showing user content
    5. Firebase Rules to limit user's read/write access to data
    6. Firebase Authentication, Login, and Logout
    7. Using Firebase to create databases and "sign up" users
    8. Several custom hooks, such as hooks for accessing global context for authorization and for accessing Firestore database
    

### What I learned / Challenges

This project showed a more real-life use of reducers, which definitely helped me better understand when they are useful. They made much more sense, though I did notice I had some initial trouble piecing the code together since I used a hook as the "middle-man". Once I started to get a better sense of where the data was gathered, how it was passed, and where it was changed, I was finally able to more easily understand the interaction. Of course, more practice would always be helpful! Indeed, this was a larger project for me so when I stepped away for a couple of days, I had to sit down and stare at it for awhile to remember how it all worked together. 

Overall, this project made me much more comfortable with custom hooks, CSS Modules, and global context.
